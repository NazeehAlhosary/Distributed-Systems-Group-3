## [3.4.0] - 2018-10-12

- ✨ Updated all dependencies and restored coverage tracking both via terminal when testing and through coveralls.io

## [3.3.0] - 2018-06-15

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- ✨ Migrated to BitBucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- ✨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis
- ✨ Removed `package-lock`

## [3.2.0] - 2018-05-14

### Improved

- ✨ Now pointing unit tests at ES Modules build, not CommonJS-one. This means, unit test coverage will be correct (higher) because there won't be any missing rows that Babel added which are impossible to cover.
- ✨ Tweaks to ava [config](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/es-modules.md) in `package.json`, properly enabling the `dev` Rollup builds.

## [3.1.0] - 2018-04-29

### Improvements

- ✨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- ✨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- ✨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code — Rollup will remove them during the builds.

## [3.0.0] - 2017-11-22

### Changed

- ✨ Rewrote in ES modules, now serving UMD, Common JS and native ES modules builds. Bumping major just in case.
- ✨ Removed JS Standard and switched to raw ESLint on `airbnb-base` preset, with no-semicolon override.

## 1.0.0 - 2017-05-22

### New

- ✨ First public release
